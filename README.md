At first the animation was made only using Adobe After Effects and code expressions, but later on an Adobe ExtendScript file was used to automatically open After Effects.
Projects was made in this order:
  - Setting composition width, height, FPS;
  - Creating project duration and increasing number value for input window (PROMT);
  - Creating composition, background, shapes and color, size, opacity and other properties for them;
  - Creatig trim path, scaling animations and adding glowing effect;
  - Setting slider controls for animation duration and number value;
  
This file can be opened using VS Code and to run it Adobe After Effects and Adobe Script Runner extensions in VS Code are necessary.
